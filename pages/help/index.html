<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<h4 id="proftswitching">What is profit-switching?</h4>
<p>
	A profit-switching pool is a virtual network of mining rigs that automatically mine the most
	<a href="#profitablity">profitable</a> coin.
</p>

<h4 id="profitablity">What is profitability?</h4>
<p>
	Profitability is the ratio of how much you can potentially earn by mining the specified coin rather than mining
	Bitcoin. e.g., a profitability of 1.2 means that the coin is currently 20% more profitable to mine than Bitcoin.
	This assumes that you immediately take the coin and trade it in for Bitcoins.
</p>

<h4 id="scrypt">What is Scrypt?</h4>
<p>
	Scrypt is the name of the algorithm used by some coins as a <a href="#poofofwork">proof-of-work</a>. By design, this
	algorithm is hard to predict, and the lucky miner who predicts a random scrypt hash earns a reward. It is the goal
	of this pool to successfully solve Scrypt hashes.
</p>

<h4 id="poofofwork">What is a proof-of-work?</h4>
<p>
	Simply put, proof-of-work is a puzzle that miners are rewarded for solving. They are typically difficult to solve
	and the payouts for solving them are unique to each coin.
</p>

<h4 id="fees">What are pool fees?</h4>
<p>
	Pool fees are the price miners pay to be part of a pool. The fees pay for server upkeep and employee payroll. The
	pool fee for MintPool is a low 1.5%
</p>

<h4 id="doge">What is Dogecoin?</h4>
<p>
	A crypto-currency based off of an internet meme of a Shiba Inu. You can learn more about it on the
