<h4 class="nopad">Frequently Asked Questions</h4>

<h4 id="proftswitching">What is profit-switching?</h4>
<p>
	A profit-switching pool is a virtual network of mining rigs that automatically mine the most
	<a href="#profitablity">profitable</a> coin.
</p>

<h4 id="payouts">How am I paid for mining?</h4>
<p>
	When the pool finds a block in any of the <a href="#scrypt">altcoins</a> it mines for, the reward is split
	proportionally amongst it's contributors (less a <a href="#fees">pool fee</a>, of course). However, depending on
	which pool a worker mines for, the pool pays out in a converted <a href="#doge">Dogecoin</a> or
	<a href="#mint">Mintcoin</a>. Payouts occur daily, usually between 2300 - 0300 CST, depending on trading volume.
	This convenience allows miners to focus more on mining, and less on using the markets to convert to their desired
	coin.
</p>

<h4 id="ports">How do I know which coin I am paid in?</h4>
<p>
	MintPool has two stratums, or servers that accept pool connections over a the internet. The stratum host for MintPool
	is <strong>stratum+tcp://mintpool.us</strong>. However, depending on which port you connect to, you will be paid out
	in that port's assigned coin. For <a href="#doge">Dogecoin</a>, use port <strong>3333</strong>, for
	<a href="mint">Mintcoin</a> use port <strong>4444</strong> or <strong>3334</strong>. Please do not forget:
	<u>you must</u> provide a username to the pool of the receiving address for the coins you earn. Failure to do
	so will treat any earned coins as a donation to the pool!
</p>

<h4 id="profitablity">What is profitability?</h4>
<p>
	Profitability is the ratio of how much you can potentially earn by mining the specified coin rather than mining
	Bitcoin. e.g., a profitability of 1.2 means that the coin is currently 20% more profitable to mine than Bitcoin.
	This assumes that you immediately take the coin and trade it in for Bitcoins.
</p>

<h4 id="scrypt">What coins does this pool mine?</h4>
<p>
	MintPool mines Scrypt-based altcoins. Scrypt is the name of the algorithm used by some coins as a
	<a href="#poofofwork">proof-of-work</a>. By design, the output (aka hash) of this algorithm is hard to predict,
	and the lucky miner who guesses it, earns a reward. It is the goal of this pool to successfully guess the hashes
	of the <a href="#profitablity">most profitable</a> coins. Here are the coins MintPool currently mines:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://dogecoin.com/">Dogecoin (DOGE)</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://getearthcoin.com/">EarthCoin (EAC)</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://litecoin.org/">LiteCoin (LTC)</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://casinoco.in/">CasinoCoin (CSC)</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://lottocoin.org/">Lottocoin (LOTTO)</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://kittehcoin.info/">KittehCoin (MEOW)</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://catcoins.biz/">Catcoin (CAT)</a></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="poofofwork">What is a proof-of-work?</h4>
<p>
	Simply put, proof-of-work is a puzzle that miners are rewarded for solving. They are typically difficult to solve
	and the payouts for solving them are unique to each coin.
</p>

<h4 id="fees">What are pool fees?</h4>
<p>
	Pool fees are the price miners pay to be part of a pool. The fees pay for server upkeep and employee payroll. The
	pool fee for MintPool is a low 1.5%
</p>

<h4 id="doge">What is Dogecoin?</h4>
<p>
	A crypto-currency based off of an internet meme of a Shiba Inu. You can learn more about it on the
	<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin">Dogecoin subreddit</a>.
</p>

<h4 id="mint">What is Mintcoin?</h4>
<p>
	MintCoin is an innovative, secure and energy efficient coin. It uses a faster
	<a href="#proofofwork">Proof-Of-Work</a> distribution mechanism to distribute the initial coins, then after 5 weeks
	the coin is basically transferred to a pure Proof-Of-Stake coin, where the generation of the coin is mainly
	through the Proof-Of-Stake interests.
